#Vending Machine Simulation
This program was produced as an assignment to the course Advanced Programming Techniques in which I was given skeleton code and told to extend it to create a program that would simulate the functions of a vending machine and demonstrate my understanding of:

* Command line arguments
* File handling
* Dynamic memory allocation in linked lists
* Modulation and multi-file programs
* Makefiles
* Function pointers

One of the criticisms I received was that several modules were #included repeatedly, because at the time I didn't understand 
the #ifndef pre-processor command.
